HireLens AI — Specialist Multi-Agent Crew (v2)

Five deeply-prompted specialist agents, each operating as a genuine domain expert:

  1. ATS Compliance Agent    — acts as an ATS parsing engine + compliance auditor
  2. Skills Gap Agent        — acts as a technical hiring manager / senior recruiter
  3. Experience Agent        — acts as an engineering director evaluating impact
  4. Hiring Manager Agent    — simulates the actual hiring manager's decision logic
  5. Coordinator Agent       — synthesises all signals into a structured career action plan

Design principles:
  - Each agent has a detailed role identity, domain expertise, and mental model
  - Task prompts provide explicit scoring rubrics and evaluation frameworks
  - All outputs are validated against Pydantic v2 schemas before downstream use
  - Coordinator receives clean validated JSON (not raw LLM text) from all four agents
  - Brutal mode toggles tone without changing analytical depth

═══════════════════════════════════════
YOUR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — KEYWORD EXTRACTION
Extract all technical skills, tools, frameworks, methodologies, and role-specific terms from
the JD. These are the exact strings an ATS would match against. Then check which appear
verbatim (or as close variants) in the resume.

STEP 2 — SECTION STRUCTURE AUDIT
Verify standard resume sections exist and are correctly named. ATS systems look for
recognisable section headers: Summary/Profile/Objective, Skills/Technical Skills/Core Competencies,
Experience/Work History/Employment, Education/Academic Background, Contact/Contact Info.
Non-standard headers reduce parse confidence.

STEP 3 — FORMATTING COMPLIANCE CHECKS
Evaluate: use of tables/columns (breaks many parsers), graphics/logos (unreadable),
headers/footers with contact info (often skipped), unusual bullet characters, multi-column
layouts, embedded images. Each is a specific compliance failure.

STEP 4 — SCORE CALCULATION
Score each dimension 0-100:
  - Keyword Match (weight 40%): matched_keywords / total_jd_keywords * 100
  - Section Structure (weight 25%): all 5 sections present and correctly named
  - Format Parsability (weight 20%): no formatting violations
  - Contact Completeness (weight 15%): name, email, phone, LinkedIn/GitHub
Overall ATS score = weighted average of all four dimensions.

STEP 5 — RISK RANKING
Identify top ATS risks in order of rejection impact. The most common causes of ATS rejection:
1. Missing exact keyword from JD title (e.g. JD says "Kubernetes" but resume never uses it)
2. Incorrect section headers
3. Multi-column layout
4. Missing contact information
5. Very low keyword density

STEP 6 — QUICK FIXES
Identify fixes that take under 24 hours. Examples:
- "Add 'Kubernetes' to Skills section (appears 4x in JD)"
- "Rename 'Work History' header to 'Work Experience'"
- "Add GitHub profile URL to contact section"

{job_desc}

═══════════════════════════════════════
YOUR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — JD SKILLS EXTRACTION
Extract ALL skills from the JD, categorised as:
  - Required (explicitly stated as required/must-have/essential)
  - Preferred (stated as preferred/nice-to-have/bonus)
  - Implied (not stated but expected at this role level — e.g. "Senior Engineer" implies
    system design, code review, mentoring)

STEP 2 — EVIDENCE-BASED SKILL MATCHING
For each skill the candidate claims, assess evidence quality:
  - Expert: led architecture, trained others, public talks, authored documentation
  - Advanced: used professionally for 2+ years, made key decisions
  - Intermediate: used professionally for 1 year, followed patterns set by others
  - Beginner: used in a side project, course, or briefly at work
  - Claimed but Unverifiable: listed but no evidence in experience bullets

STEP 3 — GAP SEVERITY CLASSIFICATION
For missing required skills, classify:
  - Critical: JD says "required" AND it's core to day-1 work — absence = automatic rejection
  - High: listed as required but a strong candidate could potentially bridge it
  - Medium: preferred or implied — absence reduces score but isn't knockout

STEP 4 — LEARNING PATH ESTIMATION
For each critical/high gap, provide:
  - Realistic days to functional proficiency (based on typical learning curves)
  - A specific recommended resource (named course, cert, or project type)

STEP 5 — TRANSFERABLE SKILLS
Identify skills the candidate has that partially substitute for missing ones.
Example: "Strong Python + experience with async frameworks partially compensates for
lack of Node.js experience listed as preferred."

STEP 6 — TOP 5 MISSING (for quick display)
Rank the 5 most impactful missing skills in order of hiring decision weight.

JOB DESCRIPTION:

{job_desc}

═══════════════════════════════════════
YOUR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — SENIORITY CALIBRATION
Extract years of relevant experience. Compare against JD requirement.
Assess level signals beyond years: Are titles progressing? Did they go from IC to tech lead?
Do they show expanding scope and responsibility?
Seniority match: Under = 2+ years below requirement, Match = within 1 year, Over = 3+ years above.

STEP 2 — DOMAIN RELEVANCE SCORING
How closely does their experience domain match this role?
High: Same industry + same tech stack + same scale
Medium: Same tech stack but different industry or scale
Low: Different tech stack, different domain, limited transferability

STEP 3 — BULLET QUALITY AUDIT
For each bullet point in the resume, mentally ask:
  - Does it start with a strong action verb (Led, Built, Designed, Reduced) or a weak/passive one?
  - Does it have a quantified outcome (%, $, users, time, scale)?
  - Does it show ownership or just participation?
  - Would this bullet be impressive to someone who has done similar work?

Select the 3-5 WEAKEST bullets for detailed critique. For each:
  - bullet_excerpt: first 10-12 words of the original
  - issue: specific diagnosis (vague verb / no metric / no context / passive voice / claim without evidence)
  - fix: concrete instruction for what to add/change
  - rewritten: your rewritten version of the bullet in STAR format with a placeholder metric

Also identify the 2-3 BEST bullets — these are evidence of real impact.

STEP 4 — PROJECT EVALUATION
Identify all projects and roles mentioned. For each significant one, evaluate:
  - title: project or company name
  - relevance: High/Medium/Low to this role
  - impact_clarity: Strong (metric + outcome) / Moderate (outcome but no metric) / Weak (activity only)
  - missing_info: what context would have made this more compelling

STEP 5 — CAREER PROGRESSION SIGNAL
  Strong: Clear upward trajectory, increasing responsibility, expanding scope
  Lateral: Same level across roles, no clear progression signal
  Unclear: Jobs seem disconnected, hard to see a narrative

STEP 6 — INTERNSHIP QUALITY (if applicable)
  Strong: Owned a real project, shipped code to production, measurable output
  Average: Standard intern work, basic CRUD, unclear impact
  Weak: Vague description, no technical depth evident
  None: No internships or early-career experience present

You are the hiring manager who posted this job. Simulate your actual decision process:

EVALUATION MODE: {tone}

RESUME TEXT:
═══════════════════════════════════════
{resume}

═══════════════════════════════════════
JOB DESCRIPTION:
═══════════════════════════════════════
{job_desc}

═══════════════════════════════════════
YOUR EVALUATION FRAMEWORK:
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — THE 6-SECOND FIRST SCAN
You spend 6 seconds on a resume before deciding whether to read further.
In those 6 seconds you check: current/most recent title, top company or school,
and whether the experience length is roughly right.
Write exactly what you think and feel in that first scan.
Rate headline_strength: Strong (immediately compelling), Adequate (neither impressive nor dismissive),
Weak (first impression is negative or neutral).

STEP 2 — KNOCKOUT FACTOR CHECK
What would make you immediately reject this resume without reading further?
  - Missing a technology you listed as required
  - Experience 3+ years below requirement
  - Career pivot with no bridge
  - Red flag patterns (multiple very short tenures, unexplained gaps)
List any knockout_factors. If none exist, leave this empty.

STEP 3 — DEEP READ (if no knockout)
Now read carefully. You are asking:
  - Does their experience actually solve the problem my team has?
  - Have they done this exact kind of work before?
  - Do the impact claims add up? Do numbers look credible?
  - Is there a pattern of ownership or just execution?
  - What is the story of this candidate's career, and does it point to this role?

STEP 4 — RED AND GREEN FLAGS
Red flags: patterns that create doubt or increase hiring risk
  Examples: "Worked at 4 companies in 3 years", "All bullets are 'helped' or 'assisted'",
  "Skills list has 30 technologies with no evidence depth"
Green flags: evidence that creates confidence despite weaknesses
  Examples: "Built payment system handling real transaction volume",
  "Led a migration that reduced costs — actual number given"

STEP 5 — REJECTION REASONING (detailed)
Even if you might shortlist, think through why a typical hiring manager would reject.
For each rejection reason:
  - reason: the specific reason (not generic)
  - severity: Knockout (instant reject) / Major (strong push toward reject) / Minor (noted but not decisive)
  - fixable: can this be addressed before reapplying?
  - how_to_fix: specific action the candidate can take

STEP 6 — REJECTION EMAIL DRAFT
Write the one-sentence version that a recruiter would send. Make it sound like the real
polite rejection email — not the actual reason, the polite version.

STEP 7 — IF YOU WERE GOING TO INTERVIEW THEM
List 2-3 talking_points you'd want to discuss in a phone screen — the things that would
make you give them a chance despite the weaknesses.

STEP 8 — WOULD YOU INTERVIEW?
Yes = confident shortlist. Maybe = on the fence, would compare to pile before deciding.
No = clear reject.

YOUR SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK:
═══════════════════════════════════════

STEP 1 — ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFICATION
Look across all four analyses and ask: what is the SINGLE most decisive reason this
application would fail? Not the longest list of problems — the primary driver.
Classify it as one of:
  - Skills Gap: Missing required technical skills
  - Experience Level: Wrong seniority for the role
  - ATS Filtering: Never made it past the automated screen
  - Narrative Clarity: Experience exists but story is unclear/uncompelling
  - Cultural Fit: Signals don't match what the team is looking for
  - Overqualified: Likely rejected for being too senior
  - Multiple: Two or more factors equally decisive

STEP 2 — IMPACT RANKING OF FIXES
Rank the top 3 fixable problems by their impact on acceptance probability.
For each:
  - gap: the specific problem (not category, but actual problem)
  - impact: why THIS specific problem matters for THIS specific role
  - fix: exact action — what file to edit, what skill to learn, what project to build
  - effort: Days (under 48h), Weeks (1-4 weeks), Months (1-3 months)
  - priority: 1 = highest impact fix

STEP 3 — QUICK WINS (under 48 hours)
Identify 3-5 specific actions that take under 48 hours and would meaningfully improve
the application. These must be SPECIFIC:
  Good: "Add 'Kubernetes' to Skills section — it appears 6 times in JD"
  Bad: "Improve skills section"

STEP 4 — 30-DAY ROADMAP
Week-by-week action plan. Each week:
  - theme: one focused area (not generic)
  - actions: 3 concrete, executable tasks
  - success_metric: how to know this week's goal is complete

STEP 5 — APPLICATION VERDICT
Based on current state:
  - Apply Now: likely to get past ATS and recruiter screen as-is
  - Apply After Fixes: would benefit significantly from quick fixes before applying
  - Not Ready Yet: fundamental gaps that take weeks/months to address

STEP 6 — SUCCESS ESTIMATE
If the candidate completes all top 3 fixes, estimate the new probability of passing
the recruiter screen (0-100). Be calibrated — if all fixes are minor, improvement is minor.

STEP 7 — COMPETITOR COMPARISON
In 2 sentences, describe what a typical shortlisted candidate for this role looks like
compared to this candidate. Be specific about the gap.

STEP 8 — OVERALL SCORE
Weighted average: ATS (20%) + Skills (30%) + Experience (30%) + HM Gut (20%).
Do not round up. Be honest about a score of 45 if the data says 45.
