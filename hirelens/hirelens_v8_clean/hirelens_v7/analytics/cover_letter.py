I am writing to express my strong interest in the {co} engineering team. After reviewing the role requirements, I believe my background in {skills_str} positions me to contribute meaningfully from day one.

In my most recent work, I {achievement.lower() if (achievement and achievement[0].isupper()) else achievement}. This experience gave me direct exposure to the kind of challenges your team is solving — and I'm eager to bring that perspective to {co}.

What draws me to this specific role is the opportunity to work at the intersection of backend systems and cloud infrastructure. I have been actively building toward this direction: strengthening my Python and API architecture skills while investing in cloud foundations to close the infrastructure gaps I know are important for this position.

A few things I would bring to your team:
- Proven ability to deliver backend systems with measurable impact
- Experience designing APIs that handle real transaction volumes
- A track record of improving system performance through systematic diagnosis rather than guesswork

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background aligns with your team's needs and where I could contribute most immediately.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
